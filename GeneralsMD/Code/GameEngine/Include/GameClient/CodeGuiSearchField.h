// Desc:   Reusable "filter this listbox" row, built in code above an existing listbox
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/*
** GeneralsX @feature Claude 27/07/2026 Reusable search field, extracted from SkirmishMapSelectMenu.
**
** Four map screens want the same row: a bold "Search" caption, a bold text entry, a one-tap clear
** button, and a listbox that shrinks to make room. The original implementation was four file
** statics on one screen; this is the same code with the state moved into an object so several
** screens can each hold their own, with no shared filter string between them.
**
** LIFETIME. This object does NOT own its windows. They are created as children of the listbox's
** parent, so the screen's WindowLayout::destroyWindows() tears them down with everything else and
** GadgetTextEntrySystem's own GWM_DESTROY frees the EntryData and its DisplayStrings. What the
** object holds is three raw pointers that MUST be forgotten the moment the engine frees the
** windows behind its back — GameWindowManager::reset() calls winDestroyAll() on match transitions.
** So: call reset() from the screen's GWM_DESTROY handler, and again before create() on the way in,
** because winDestroy only QUEUES a window and GWM_DESTROY arrives later from processDestroyList
** (reopening a screen in the frame it closed would otherwise see a stale entry pointer and skip
** construction entirely).
**
** IDS. Both id names are caller-supplied and must be unique process-wide: an id-less window gets
** NAMEKEY_INVALID and winGetWindowFromId( nullptr, id ) would match the wrong screen's field. Use
** the owning .wnd's prefix, e.g. "SkirmishMapSelectMenu.wnd:TextEntryMapSearch".
