/*
** GeneralsX @feature Claude 26/07/2026 Debug overlay reachable from the shell AND from in-game.
**
** This is deliberately NOT a Shell screen. Shell::doPush hardcodes winCreateLayout(filename) and
** would run MainMenuShutdown on whatever is underneath, which is wrong for something that also has
** to open on top of a running match. It is an off-stack WindowLayout built with CodeGui, exactly
** the pattern Shell::getOptionsLayout already uses, so the same instance serves both entry points
** and Back is a plain destroy with no pop/shutdownComplete handshake to stall on.
**
** GeneralsX @feature Claude 27/07/2026 The cheats work in a LAN game.
**
** They are appended to TheMessageStream as MSG_GX_CHEAT_* orders, which sit in the 1000..1999
** network band and are therefore shipped to every peer, deleted locally, and re-delivered - to the
** sender too - on one stamped logic frame in fixed slot order. Every peer runs the identical
** handler on the identical frame, so there is nothing left to diverge and the old
** single-player-only gate is gone. Each order carries an explicit TARGET PLAYER INDEX, so a cheat
** can be aimed at any player rather than always the local one. Two consequences worth knowing:
** the effect lands a few frames after the tap, on the sender's screen as well, and both peers must
** be running the same binary because the enum values ARE the protocol.
**
** GeneralsX @feature Claude 27/07/2026 Spawn and delete get their own tab.
**
** Spawning used to mean typing an exact INI Object name into a text box, which is not something
** anyone can do on a touch device and gave nothing back but "no such template" when it went wrong.
** It is now a searchable list of every template the ThingFactory knows, with a count stepper, a
** veterancy cycle and three named delete actions - so the DELETE_OBJECTS order's "every type" and
** "all of them" sentinels are buttons rather than zeroes the user has to know to type.
**
** It is a SEPARATE PANE from Cheats because the panes are a fixed height and Cheats was already
** near the bottom of it; a control laid out past its parent's rect is invisible and unhittable, not
** merely clipped. The two panes share one target player - the Spawn pane reads the Cheats pane's
** selection and says so - because two target lists on one screen is a bug waiting to be filed.
